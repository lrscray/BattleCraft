Collectors are mindless, goal-oriented machines and are unaffected by enemies.

Defenders will move freely on the terrain and will immediatly herd civillians into their homes once enemies are present.
Defenders will attack enemies once all civillians are safe.

Civillians are the health of the base. Don't let them die.
Civillians will wander aimlessly and mindlessly, completely oblivious to any dangers that may approach them.

# ENEMIES:
There are two types of enemies. One group of enemies will attack buildings.
The other group of enemies will target civillians. If no civillians are available, they will target the defenders. And once there is no defenders, they will target the buildings.

# GOAL:
The goal is to build your base in a way in which all of you do not lose all of your civillians. You have 1 minute before enemies are spawned nearby.
Defeat all the enemies of the wave to win. Lose all civilians and you lose the game.
